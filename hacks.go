// The hacks package contains various utilities for common and typical cases.
//
// This package and its sub-packages are "perpetually unstable": the composition
// of packages and their API's change without warning or tag versioning,
// depending on personal needs, requirements and preferences, as well as when
// official packages emerge that duplicate the behavior of current ones. Use
// vendoring to fix the specific state of the desired package, or simply copy
// the required utilities manually.
